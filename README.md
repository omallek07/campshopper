## CampShopper

I wanted to refresh my understanding of advanced Sequelize models, model associations, and data fetching methods in another version of the GraceShopper E-Commerce project I did with my team during Fullstack Academy.  With additional time,  I would like to continue the backend code and then start focusing on React for the front end UI and Redux for state management.
